# LUNI v0.8-pre
# This repository is a fork of the Ion Universe Public Server in an attempt to make the sufficient changes/fixes to get the project working.

1) Server Issues
  
  - The server runs on CuzitsJonny's source code. I give him full credit as I did not make this code. Its not a full version of LEGO Universe which means it can be unstable
  
  - The message "Server Is Under Maintence" means the world server crashed. Give it a few minutes to restart
  
  - The message "Server Is loading resources" is self explanitory, give it a few seconds. If you spam the Enter button you will promted with a message saying to update your client. If you do, just close the client and re-open it.
